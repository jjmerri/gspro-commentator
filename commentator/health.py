"""Booth health: is the foundation (GSPro's log lines, the HUD the booth reads by OCR) still what the
booth was built against?

A GSPro update can reword its log, move the HUD, or rename a data tile; a monitor change or a re-picked
tile can do the same. None of that crashes the booth: the reads just quietly come back empty or wrong.
So deterministic checks run at startup, at every round start (the booth is left running for days), and
after every round, and anything off is raised here. The ON AIR badge shows a warning chip while any
issue is open (hover for the list), and every change is logged and saved to `log_dir/health.json`,
with each round's report card appended to `log_dir/health-history.jsonl`.

An issue is keyed (a re-check updates or clears it in place) and is either a `warn` (worth a look) or a
`fail` (a read the booth depends on is broken). A `verify` issue ("GSPro was updated") isn't broken
yet, only unproven: the next round whose checks all pass clears it.
