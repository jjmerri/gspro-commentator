"""Builds the league file and league history from the league's yearly spreadsheets.

Each workbook has Schedule, Teams, Results and Standings sheets. Standings hold cumulative
points per week, so each week's points are the difference, and the place follows from the
points table (a tie splits the points of the places it covers). Emails are never read.

Re-running keeps what was added by hand to the league file: handicaps, notes, GSPro names,
pronouns, nicknames, storylines, handicap allowances and pronunciations.
